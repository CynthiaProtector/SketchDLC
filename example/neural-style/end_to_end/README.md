# End to End Neural Art

This is an implementation of blog: [http://dmlc.ml/mxnet/2016/06/20/end-to-end-neural-style.html](http://dmlc.ml/mxnet/2016/06/20/end-to-end-neural-style.html)


We will release a Multi-GPU training code soon.

## How to use


1. First use `download.sh` to download pre-trained model and sample inputs

2. Then prepare training dataset according to the blog

3. Modify [boost_train.py](boost_train.py)

## Pretrained Model

Weight [https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/raw/master/mxnet/art/model.zip](https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/raw/master/mxnet/art/model.zip)
Inference [boost_inference.py](boost_inference.py)
